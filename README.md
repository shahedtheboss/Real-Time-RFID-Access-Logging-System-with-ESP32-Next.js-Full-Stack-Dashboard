# Real-Time-RFID-Access-Logging-System-with-ESP32-Next.js-Full-Stack-Dashboard
Late-night boredom = unexpected innovation.

Last night, I had a random urge to build something that blends my skills in embedded systems and full-stack web development — and out came this small but powerful project: an RFID-based access logger 

Built with:

ESP32 + MFRC522 to detect RFID tags

Custom API with Next.js (Node backend) to log entries in real time

Responsive React frontend to display who accessed the system and when — clean, auto-updating, and mobile-ready

All connected via WiFi and REST API — no external platforms needed

Features:
Logs every card tap with a UID and timestamp

Displays all access logs neatly on a live dashboard

Auto-resets, handles refreshes, and keeps things seamless

Fully self-hosted, lightweight, and extendable (e.g., for servo control, door locks, etc.)

This wasn’t planned, scripted, or part of any course — just a spontaneous build when creativity struck at 1 AM.

Tech Stack:
ESP32 | MFRC522 | Arduino C++ | Next.js Full Stack | REST API | React | CSS

It’s a small project, but the kind of integration I love — where hardware meets software, and ideas turn into working systems overnight.

Let’s keep building.
